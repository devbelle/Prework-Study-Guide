# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The prework-Study-Guide project is my first web project. This is an introductory lesson into a full-stack web developemnt career for those, such as myself, interested in learnign more about coding. Through this web application, I have learned more about the web development field and the challenges faced when creating websites. Through reveiwing over basic concepts such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Github, any person can create a foundation for web development.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
